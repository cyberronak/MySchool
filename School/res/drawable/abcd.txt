1 Introduction
The introduction of the specification will provide an overview of the entire specification . It will contain the following subsections.

Edit
1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the “Project Management System(PMS)“application. It will illustrate the purpose and complete declaration for the development of system. It will also explain application constraints, interface and interactions with other external applications. This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a customer for its approval and a reference for developing and testing the first version of the system for the development and QA team.

Edit
1.2 Scope

Project Management System(PMS) application is a web based application which will help to define and bifurcate application requirements. It will bifurcate major features,sub features,User interface details of the application. It also combine common features in a form of template.This application will also define how these all are interrelate with each other.
PMS will have major Authentication,Project Management,Section management,Function Management, UI management and Template Management features/modules.

1.5 Overview

The rest of this specification is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an overall description of the application,interfaces details.It gives what level of proficiency is expected of the user, some general constraints while making the software and some assumptions and dependencies that are assumed. Section 3 gives specific requirements which the software is expected to deliver.External interface will give the User interface details,functional requirment will give feature/module detail of the software.Non Functional requirment will give detail of that points that is indirectly affected to the system/application/software.

2 Overall description
This section will give an overview of the whole system. The system will be explained in its context to introduce the basic functionality of it.At last,it will give information about the constraints/limitation,out of the scope and assumptions for the system will be presented.

Edit
2.1 Product perspective

PMS is aimed towards a person who has project/application and needs to be divided it's requirement into major features,sub features to understand flow of the application easily.It also needs to interrelate user interface(UI) and functionality with each other.
PMS should be user-friendly, ‘quick to learn’,reliable and easy to use to enter multiple entries of different projects or applications.
PMS is intended to be a stand-alone product and should not depend on the availability of other software. It should run on Windows and Linux based platform.
This application has some restriction like you have to use your domain authentication to access the application.Application can be run on maximum 50 connection simultaneously not more than that.
Edit
2.2 Product functions

PMS application is divided into into 5 major modules : Authentication,Project Management,Section Management,User Interface Management,Function Requirement Management and Template Management.

Through authentication, user will do login into the application.User will create the project through project management feature. User will bifurcate major modules of the project and divide the functionality into major features and sub features and add those details into Section management and feature management. User will club all common features and put it into Template management. mock up and screen shot of the application will place under User Interface Management.

Introduction
Project Management System(PMS) is mainly used to divide the application or project major functions in a form of feature,sub features,common template to simplify the application flow. There are few major modules available in the application:Authentication,Project Management,Section Management,UI Management,Feature Management and Template Management.We first do the login into the application,add a project/application details,add major modules/features of the project/application then add sub features of the modules/features.If application/project may have some common features,club all together and create as a template.Also add mock up or screen shot of the application/project.
All list are sorted by created date in descending order by default.
Multiple delete is provided to perform multiple delete operation at same time.
Edit
Authentication

When you browse the application(PMS),it will ask for authentication first time. You need to mention your domain username and password to login into the application.Once you authenticate into it, you don't need to mention your domain username and password until you are not cleared the cookies.
Once you login into the application , it will redirect to you on “Dashboard”.
Edit
Project Management

Project Management feature is mainly used to manage project related details. It is divided into 4 parts: Add project,update project,delete project and view projects.
Edit
Project List

It will display list of all projects with system Date.

Edit: This link will redirect you on project page with existing record to modify it.
Delete: When you click on delete , it will pop up the message, “Are you sure ?” Ok will delete the project and Cancel will remove the pop up message and redirect on Dashboard page.
When you click on “name of the project”, it will redirect you on project view page.It will give respective project details like related Features,User Interface,common templates,Sections etc.
There will be search functionality on “Project Title” to search the project.
Edit
Project

To create a new project, you will have to move on the project page.
PR: is the project id.This value is unique,mandatory and auto incremental field.
Title: is the project title and also mandatory field.
Description: is used to mention description of the project.It supports multilingual.
Save: When you hit the save button,it will display “Record saved successfully”message.Simultaneously, pop up window will open with message and yes,no buttons:“Do you want to add another record?”If user will hit “Yes”button then existing records from the screen will be cleared and screen will ready to enter new record.When user will hit “No” button, it will redirect on “Dashboard”.
